 A regression model with the XGBoost library was developed to predict bus arrival delays using a dataset containing 2,179 samples with features such as dwell_time, scheduled_travel_time, upstream_stop_delay, and recurrent_delay. The target variable is the arrival_delay.
 The dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing, and feature normalization was applied using StandardScaler. A grid search (GridSearchCV) with 5-fold cross-validation was employed to tune the hyperparameters and the objective function used was the mean squared error.
 The best parameters obtained were:
 n_estimators: 300
learning_rate: 0.05
max_depth: 3
subsample: 0.8
colsample_bytree: 0.7
 The final model achieved a performance on the test set with a MSE of 223.18, MAE of 10.95, and an RÂ² of 0.99. The RMSE was 14.93.
I learned the importance of making an informed choice of parameter values to improve the performance of regression models. I also reviewed the documentation and used the feature_importances_ attribute, which provides a normalized vector indicating the importance of each feature in the model's predictions. I found that "Upstream_stop_delay" is the most significant feature, with an importance value of 0.93. 
These techniques could also be applied to other transportation problems, such as estimating travel demand, travel times and the operational costs.
